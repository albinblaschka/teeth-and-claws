## Title: Analysis of development of functional groups
## Author: Albin Blaschka - albin.blaschka@standortsanalyse.net

## This script is part of the analysis done for my doctoral thesis. For a full description see (in german):
## Blaschka, A., 2015. Mit Zähnen und Klauen: Erhalt und Wiederherstellung von Ökosystemleistungen
## einer alpinen Kulturlandschaft. Doctoral Thesis, Paris Lodron Universität Salzburg.
## doi:10.13140/RG.2.1.3582.6724

## To study the changes in vegetation and restoration of pastures already infested with shrubs by targeted
## pasturing, a trial following a factorial design was set up, with four replicates. The development of
## three functional groups (dwarf shrubs, herbs and open soil) is analysed with a GLM.

## The script takes advantage of features of the IDE R-Studio (http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio),
## namely of the different panes, but is fully functional on the plain vanilla R-Console
## It was developed under R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16) -- "Full of Ingredients"
## It uses the stargazer package, Version 5.1 (see below)

## Metadata:
## See also the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/albinblaschka/teeth-and-claws,
## specially the file metadata.txt

## Data file: data_functionalgroups_development.csv: 178 observations of 5 variables
## Definition of columns is also available via a *.csvt - file: see http://www.gdal.org/drv_csv.html for explanation

## Columns:
## variant: Factor, 4 levels "A","B","C","D"
##      A: Null variant, no impact
##      B: First mown, followed by targeted pasturing
##      C: Only targeted pasturing
##      D: Extensive pasturing, browsing
## year: int - denotes the duration of the trial (4 years); variant D was started one year later as the other variants (3 years)
## replicate: int - four replicates were used for all variants
## functionaltype: Factor, 3 levels - "open soil","dwarf shrubs", "herbs"
## frequency: cover of the functional types, measured with a quadrat (1m², divided by 10cm by 10cm): Dependent variable
